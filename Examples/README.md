In this directory, different modulation schemes ranging from the most basic BPSK until the more elaborated OFDM, applied in current wireless communcation systems such as LTE. 
Although this examples are mainly simulations without any real transmission and reception of data, the highlighting feature of this directory relies on the profound explanations about 
the parameters that control the functionality of both hardware and software. In the repository X, you will have basically the same functional block, but the radio module will be 
implemented and comprehensively explained.
