In this directory, you can find the simulation of a QPSK transciever. 


## Understanding QPSK

The Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QSPK) is a digital modulation scheme charaterized by the phase change by 180 degrees. Therefore, it uses only one bit to modulate data in one of the two constellation points
