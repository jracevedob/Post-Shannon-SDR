In this directory, you can find the simulation of a BPSK transciever. 


## Understanding BPSK

The Binary Phase Shift Keying (BSPK) is a digital modulation scheme charaterized by the phase change by 180 degrees. Therefore, it uses only one bit to modulate data in one of the two constellation points
