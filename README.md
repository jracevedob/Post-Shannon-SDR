In this repository, you will find the source code for analyzing tracks during data transmission using Software Defined Radios. Metrics about error positioning and error syndrom are attached.

##Overview

In this repository, you will find the source code and data blocks for implementing different types of digital transmission in GNURadio.
For this test, the Ettus Research N310 SDR was under use and the data analysis was performed using Python.

##Quick Start

The installation of GNURadio is taken directly for the official Ettus Research website under the following link
https://kb.ettus.com/Building_and_Installing_the_USRP_Open-Source_Toolchain_(UHD_and_GNU_Radio)_on_Linux
In our case, we have done the installation in an Ubuntu 18.04 system.
