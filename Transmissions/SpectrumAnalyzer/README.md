In this example, it is presented a spectrum analyzer in which the user can select a frequency, also denominated as tunning, to be sensed. Additionally, a 
filtering stage is presented to remove the frequency components derived from noise or compositions of the transmitted signal. By using a frequency Xlating FIR filter, a frequency translation and an anti-aliasing filter can be applied to the signal.
