This folder contains the hand-crafted GNURadio modules developed for the acceleration of the base band functions. For more information about the development of the Python wrappers for C++ function, please refer to the following [Link](https://wiki.gnuradio.org/index.php/Guided_Tutorial_GNU_Radio_in_C%2B%2B). We highly recommend to the reader to have a basic to intermediate knowledge about Object-oriented Programming (OOP) in order to fully comprehend the structure and functionality of the source code.

The C++ programming language is a high level and highly portable language which enables the implementation of performance-critical code for large-scale applications. As example, we provide a stetp-by-step implementation and compilation of a preamble block, mainly used fro the syncrhonization of data transmitted through the air between the USRP N310.
